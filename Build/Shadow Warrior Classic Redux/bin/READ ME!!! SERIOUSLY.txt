The config file for Raze3D uses the same naming convention as GZDoom, which means the INI file is named like this:
- raze-[Computer_Name].ini

Where:
[Computer_Name] is your username. So, for example, if you're running Windows 10 and your username is DESKTOP-123ABC, then the config file should be named:
- raze-DESKTOP-123ABC.ini
