Installation
============

Just put the gladiator.exe, mapnames.dat and default.gsf files in the directory you have
installed the Gladiator Bot to e.g. c:\quake2\gladiator and run it. First thing to do is 
set up some basic settings and then save it as the default config. Then you are free to
setup as many custom configs as you like. The rest should be self explanatory :) If you 
have problems or find a bug please email me at address above. Thanks :)

Version: 0.6.1
==============

Minor release to add support for reading mapnames from aas*.zip files.

Version: 0.6.0
==============

-Added support for CTF and RocketArena options. (Along with Xatrix and Rogue altho not
 checked cos I don't own them :P) Easiest way to play these is to copy the appropriate PAK 
 from the mod into your Gladiator directory then select the mod in Gladiator!, set your 
 options and go!
-Fixed Bots List to support v0.92 format. Currently there is no support for custom bot 
 characters because I'm redoing the whole bot section to allow full editing of all 
 characteristics. Hence the BotGenerator is temporarily disabled too :(
-Added support for a number of the newer options too, the rest will be added next release.

Version: 0.5.4
==============

-Added support for Gladiator Bot v0.9 bots.cfg file. It's NOT backwards compatible so to use
 Gladiator! 0.5.4 you MUST be using Gladiator Bot v0.9.
-Integrated BotMaker program and updated it to new format.
-Fixed quirky bug that wouldn't load the correct map filename when loading a custom config.
-Finally enabled Map Rotation/Cycling (Thanks to Mr.E for syntax :P) Just hit the "Enable 
 Rotation" checkbox and add some maps to the list and you are in business. As each map ends,
 the next will play, then loop.
-Added a few other minor things which you might or might not notice :)

Version: 0.5.0
==============

-Made a few minor bug fixes
-Huge interface overhaul, most of previous controls altered for ease of use
-Added options to Add/Edit Bots (Name/Model/Skin/Profile), although naturally they must
 retain one of the 6 inbuilt personalities.
-Added sequential demo filename option to stop accidental overwrite of demos
-Finished options for Map Rotation, just has to be supported by mod now (ahem)
-Added Map titles
-Added option to specify external .cfg file
-Added player selection screen, with skin preview and options to change name/skin etc. as 
 well as rate, max FPS and mouse speed.
-Added simple bind editor, mainly for purpose of specifying Gladiator Bot specific binds
 without messing up your existing .cfg files
-Tidied up code, speeded up listviews and added more error checking :)


Version: 0.3.5
==============

-Initial Release!
