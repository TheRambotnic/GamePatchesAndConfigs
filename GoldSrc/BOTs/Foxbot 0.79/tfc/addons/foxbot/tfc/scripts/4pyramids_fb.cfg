//4Pyramids foxbot script by Spider Man
//For use with the foxbot waypoint file 
//for 4Pyramids done by Spider Man. 
//I did not feel like putting 3 colored 
//flag waypoints on each flag.
//Each flag is numbered according to team.
//No team can pick up their own flag.
//Only one goal per team and they are
//color coded so they did not need to be
//scripted. No messages on the four 
//redetable walls :( so they could not be 
//scripted.
